## SQL
* What is the difference between a View and a Table?
  - Table: contains data, collection of related data entries consisting of rows and columns.
  - View: A virtual table, or a SELECT statement that has been saved in the db. You can't change anything in the db, just a set of tables (views don't store actual data)
* What does the HAVING clause do?
